    <h2>Maple French Toast</h2>
    <p>A sandwich with all the comfort. You can cook the bacon in a skillet instead of the oven, if desired. I also sprinkled
    the sandwich with cinnamon.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 slices maple-cured bacon</li>
        <li>7 eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>4 slices bread</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon maple syrup, or to taste</li>
   
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Lay bacon strips in a single
        layer on prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Beat 3 eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a large, shallow bowl. Dip each slice of bread into egg
        mixture to saturate completely.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook bread slices in hot oil, turning once, until
        browned on each side, about 5 minutes. Transfer toast to a plate.</li>
        <li>Beat remaining eggs in a bowl. Cook and stir eggs in the same skillet over medium heat until eggs are scrambled and set,
        3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place 1 slice of toast on a plate and top with 1/2 of the bacon, 1/2 of the scrambled eggs, and 1 slice of toast. Repeat
        with remaining toast, bacon, and eggs. Top each sandwich with maple syrup.</li>
    </ol>
